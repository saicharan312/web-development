   The main objective of this project is to design and develop computerized system, which would be helpful to carry out the information storage. Improper monitoring of food consumption leads schools to run out of rations.This system involves taking down stocks data on piece of papers, which are then put in to the files and filed in cabinets. Another problem is the missing of pieces of information. The existing manual system has got many disadvantages.  It is difficult to maintain records manually.So we developed a website that consists of a BEO admin login, food department superior officer login, school headmaster login. The system is beneficial for school headmaster as well as students. All the stock details to be uploaded daily according to the stocks used and consumed at that day. It is very efficient system and provides high degree of maintenance and provides a better and easy record facility.
