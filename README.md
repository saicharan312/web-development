# binary-search
This is one of the important searching technique used when n is very large.it follows divide and conquer technique to search for a particular element in an array
its time complexity is measured with the help of three notations: best case(big-oh),average case(big-theta),worst case(big ohmega) in each and every case its time complexity is same i.e, o(nlogn).In each iteration it is going to divide the given array into two substrings until an element is found.
